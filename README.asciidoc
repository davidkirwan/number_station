=== Installation ===

 gem install number_station

=== Usage ===

==== Configuration ====

Create the initial configuration:

 number_station create_config

This creates `~/number_station/conf.yaml` and copies template files (`intro_message.txt`, `outro_message.txt`, `repeat_message.txt`) to the same directory.

==== Agent Management ====

Manage agents using the `agents` subcommand:

Create an agent:

 number_station agents create NAME [--location LOCATION] [--handler HANDLER]

Activate/Deactivate:

 number_station agents activate NAME [--start-date DATE]
 number_station agents deactivate NAME [--end-date DATE]

Update handler codeword:

 number_station agents update-handler NAME HANDLER

View agents:

 number_station agents list              # Active agents only
 number_station agents list-all          # All agents with history
 number_station agents stats             # Detailed statistics

==== One-Time Pads ====

Create pads:

 number_station pad create [--name AGENT] [--numpads NUM] [--length LENGTH]

If `--name` is provided, creates pad in `~/number_station/pads/AGENT/` directory.
Defaults: 500 pads, 500 characters (rounded up to nearest multiple of 5).

View pad statistics:

 number_station pad stats [--path PATH]

Shows pad statistics grouped by agent, including unconsumed pad counts.

==== Message Encryption/Decryption ====

Encrypt:

 number_station encrypt [MESSAGE] [--file FILE] [--agent AGENT] [--padpath PADPATH] [--numpad NUMPAD]

If `--agent` is provided, searches for oldest pad in agent-specific directory.
Only active agents can encrypt messages.

Decrypt:

 number_station decrypt [MESSAGE] [--file FILE] [--padpath PADPATH] [--numpad NUMPAD]

==== Phonetic Conversion ====

Convert to phonetic:

 number_station convert_to_phonetic FILE [--intro INTRO_FILE] [--outro OUTRO_FILE] [--repeat REPEAT_FILE]

Converts encrypted message to phonetic alphabet. Output saved as `FILENAME_phonetic.txt`.
Intro, outro, and repeat messages are included as-is (not converted).

Convert to espeak XML:

 number_station convert_to_espeak PHONETIC_FILE

Generates GLaDOS-style espeak XML file. Output saved as `FILENAME.xml`.

Generate MP3:

 number_station convert_to_mp3 XML_FILE

Converts XML to MP3 using espeak and ffmpeg. Output saved as `FILENAME.mp3`.

Play audio:

 number_station espeak XML_FILE

Plays the XML file using espeak with GLaDOS voice settings.
